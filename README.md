# 8052AH-SBC
This is a 8052AH Single Board Computer designed by Datafant (Sweden) in the 1980's.
I worked there 1985-1989 and when I left I got this board as a gift.
It is in working condition and I decided to do the schematic for it in KiCad. 
When I did the schematic I discovered a bug in the PCB, there is a rare RTC in the design that has pin 1 and pin 16 mixed up.
The schematic is with this fixed and I had to modify the board to get the RTC working.
The RTC is an EM M3003, documentation for it has been supplied to me.

More to come......
